# flight-Booking
Our group built a flight booking website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Users can search, compare, and book flights easily. We focused on a responsive design, smooth navigation, and interactive features. This project helped us enhance our web development skills and create a user-friendly site.
